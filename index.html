					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello all, my name is Nhat and I am a 4th year CS:GD major. I enjoy playing games with friends and working out from time to time.
						I also enjoy social games and meeting new people although I don't actively seek that out. Some of the games that I have been playing and super mid at are Magic:The gathering,
						League of Legends, Hades 2, Apex Legends, and Minecraft. As for my programming experience, I am familiar with C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. Thanks for reading and I hope to meet some of yall.
