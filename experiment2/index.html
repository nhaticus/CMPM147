				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experiement, I am trying to replicate a flower field, specifically a sunflower field. Someone about a sunflower field just looks so 
					nice and calming to me and I wanted to try and replicate that. Though the initial idea was to create a lively field with moving part, in the end I was only able to make the cloud look more dynamic.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used a function to draw a sunflower from a point to the bottom of the screen and then generate leaves, petals, and such based off of that. 
					Then for the clouds, I created a class that would generate a cloud out of circles and have it slowly drift across the screen.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I feel that given more time I could defnitely make this look a lot nicer and prettier. On top of that if I had the time to do more research I might be able to find a way to make it run smoother.</p>
